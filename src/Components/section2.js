          Electronics Club, earlier started as a hobby group has now expanded into a students’ organisation with the objective of inculcating a spirit of developing innovative, cutting edge technology solutions to real life problems.
          <p className="greentext">
            We provide a platform to the students’ body where any individual with an idea can approach the club freely to grasp the necessary technical skills required to turn that idea into a reality.

We conduct a plethora of lectures, workshops, projects as well as competitions throughout the year concerning both analog as well as digital electronics keep the calendar busy and the participants, learning.

            <p className="additionaltext">
            Our summer projects are indeed a stepping stone for many freshers to develop interest in a particular field which help them in their future projects/internships/startups. We have not restricted ourselves to any specific domains but our branches span across various domains like embedded systems and IOT, VLSI, signal processing,ML and AI. Over the past few years, we have taken up various Industrial projects offered to us by well-known Indian research organisations like DRDO, BARC INDIA (Broadcast Audience Research Council), BETIC.
